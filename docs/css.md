# CSS Lesson (Minimal)

CSS is the **style** of a web page. You will only edit a few lines today.

Your file
- [docs/css/styles.css](docs/css/styles.css)

Basic example (type this)
```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background: #f7f7fb;
  color: #1f2937;
}

h1 {
  color: #1a73e8;
}
```

Micro‑task
1) Change the background color to any color you like.
2) Change the `h1` color.

You do not need to be an artist. Just test one small change at a time.

Typing matters
- Type it. Don’t paste.
- The goal is muscle memory.
