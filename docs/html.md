# HTML Lesson (Minimal)

HTML is the **structure** of a web page. This lesson only covers the basics you must know.

Your file
- [docs/index.html](docs/index.html)

Basic HTML5 template (type this structure)
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
		<title>My Student Page</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Your Name</h1>
		<p>Welcome to my page.</p>
		<a href="https://www.njit.edu">NJIT</a>
		<script src="js/scripts.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

Tags you must know
1) `h1` to `h6` = headings
2) `p` = paragraph
3) `a` = link

Where CSS goes
- Inline: `<p style="color: red;">Hello</p>`
- In a `<style>` tag inside `<head>`
- In a separate file (recommended): `css/styles.css`

Micro‑task
1) Change the `<h1>` to your name.
2) Change the `<p>` to one sentence about you.

Why you must type it
- Typing builds muscle memory and improves recall.
- You will move faster later because your hands know the commands.

You are not expected to memorize tags. Just practice reading and editing them.
