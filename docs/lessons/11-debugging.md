# Debugging Checklist

If something doesn’t work, check these in order:
1) Did you save the file?
2) Are you in the correct folder? (`pwd`)
3) Does your folder tree match the project map?
4) Are your file paths correct?
   - CSS: `css/styles.css`
   - JS: `js/scripts.js`
5) Is the server running? (if using `http.server`)
6) Any errors in the browser console?
