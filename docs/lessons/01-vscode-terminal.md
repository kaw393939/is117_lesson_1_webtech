# VS Code + Terminal Basics

Why this matters
- You are learning to drive the “bus” of VS Code and the terminal.
- Typing builds muscle memory and reduces mistakes later.

Open the terminal
- VS Code → View → Terminal

What you see in VS Code
- Explorer = files and folders
- Tabs = what you are editing
- Terminal = where you type commands

Terminal mini cheat sheet
- `pwd` = where am I?
- `ls` or `dir` = what files are here?
- `cd <folder>` = go into a folder
- `mkdir <name>` = make a new folder
- `touch <file>` or `New-Item <file>` = make a new file

Type it, don’t paste
- Typing builds real skill.
- Your brain learns the patterns.
