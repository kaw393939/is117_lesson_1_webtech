# Project Structure

Your folder tree must look exactly like this:
```
is117first/
  docs/
    index.html
    css/
      styles.css
    js/
      scripts.js
  package.json
```

Why this structure
- It keeps files organized.
- It matches how small web projects are commonly built.
- It works with GitHub Pages if you publish from `docs/`.

Check your work
Run this command and compare the output:
```bash
ls -R is117first
```

If it doesn’t match, stop and fix it before moving on.
