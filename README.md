# IS117 Student Webpage — Chapter 1

Welcome to your first chapter in the web tech stack. This is about learning to drive the “bus” of VS Code and the terminal.

Why we type (no copy/paste)
- Typing builds muscle memory.
- Muscle memory reduces mistakes later.
- Typing forces your brain to notice patterns.

The bus metaphor (keep it simple)
- Bus = your VS Code workspace
- Steering wheel = file explorer
- Dashboard = editor tabs
- Clutch + gear shift = terminal commands (`cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`)
- Gas/brake = start/stop the local server
- Mirrors = Live Preview / browser

What you are building
- A tiny website with 1 HTML file, 1 CSS file, and 1 JavaScript file.
- You will create every file and folder from scratch to match this structure.

Note on SSH keys
- If you switch to WSL2, you must create a **new** SSH key inside WSL2.
- SSH keys are tied to the machine/environment where you create them.

How to use this chapter
- Start here: [docs/lessons/00-start-here.md](docs/lessons/00-start-here.md)
- Do one step at a time.
- If you get stuck, ask for help with the exact error.

What to do first (quick checklist)
1) Open VS Code.
2) Open the Terminal inside VS Code (View → Terminal).
3) Follow your OS setup page.
4) Type every command yourself (no copy/paste).

What you will learn (keep it short)
- HTML = structure
- CSS = style
- JavaScript = behavior
- Node.js + npm = project setup tools
- VS Code + terminal = how you move around and create files

Why we use WSL2 on Windows
- It gives Windows students a Linux terminal like macOS.
- That means we can use the same commands in class.
- PowerShell is allowed, but treated as a fallback.

Why Linux is the smart move (short version)
- Linux has been stable for 30+ years.
- Most technology creators use Linux for development and servers.
- Learning Linux is vendor‑neutral and future‑proof.
- It maximizes the value of your learning time.

Assignment (your first build)
1) Create the folder structure from scratch.
2) Create the files listed in the project map.
3) Open the folder in VS Code.
4) Add basic content to each file (use the lessons for guidance).
5) Preview in the browser.
6) Commit your work with Git.
